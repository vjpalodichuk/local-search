 * The SearchVariable interface is one of the course interfaces that LocalSearch uses to operate on problems.
 * The SearchVariable defines a simple interface so that the LocalSearch class doesn't have to concern itself with
 * the specific types of variables and values bieng used. SearchVariables are ubiquitous in that they are both a
 * variable and can be used as a value. In fact, the LocalSearch class depends on the SearchVariable instance being
 * able to accept SearchVariables as values. The VariableDomain demonstrates this requirement.

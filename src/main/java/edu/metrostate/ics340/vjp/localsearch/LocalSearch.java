/**
 * <p>
 * This particular LocalSearch class uses an Iterative Best Improvement strategy to ensure that a solution is found if
 * one exists. We start with a Random Start and if we don't have a solution, we go walking by first selecting a
 * variable and then randomly select a value from that variable's domain. If the variable value pair improves the
 * current assignment we accept the variable and value; otherwise we reject it. In both cases we start walking again.
 * We select the variable by the one that has the highest conflict score. The ConstraintList randomly decides
 * which variable to return if more than one variable are tied for the highest conflict score.
 * <p>
 * To ensure we don't keep trying the same variable value pair we keep a small tabu list
 * for the current variable of the values that were already tried. If we move to a new variable, the tabu list is
 * cleared and a new one started for the new variable. The size of the Tabu list is the size of the domain of possible
 * values for that variable up to a max of 256. This way we don't consume too much memory of the domain is infinite or
 * really large.
 * <p>
 * If we get stuck on the same variable that has the most conflicts we perform a Random Walk where we randomly select a
 * new variable from the list of variables with conflicts that is not our current variable. If we are unsuccessful in
 * selecting another variable we perform a Random Restart and begin again. Additionally, if we have not found a
 * solution by the time we have walked (typically domain size * number of variables but is capped at 256) iterations,
 * we perform a Random Restart.
 * <p>
 * To avoid not halting search may be called with an option non-zero value. The value represents the maximum number of
 * assignments to try before completely giving up finding a solution.
